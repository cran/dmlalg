\title{dmlalg: double machine learning algorithms}
\description{
The \code{dmlalg} package contains implementations of
double machine learning (DML) algorithms in \code{R}.

\section{Partially linear models with confounding variables}{
    Our goal is to perform inference for the linear parameter in partially
    linear models with confounding variables.
    The standard DML estimator of the linear parameter has a two-stage least
    squares interpretation, which can lead to a large variance and overwide
    confidence intervals.
    We apply regularization to reduce the variance of the estimator,
    which produces narrower confidence intervals that are approximately valid.
    Nuisance terms can be flexibly estimated with machine learning algorithms.
